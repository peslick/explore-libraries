#' Which libraries does R search for packages?
.libPaths()

#' Installed packages
installed.packages()

## use installed.packages() to get all installed packages
instPckgs <- installed.packages()
instPckgs <- data.frame(instPckgs)

## how many packages?
nrow(instPckgs)

#' Exploring the packages

## count some things! inspiration
##   * tabulate by LibPath, Priority, or both
LibPaths <- unique(instPckgs$LibPath)
countLibPaths <- sapply(LibPaths, function(x) {length(instPckgs$LibPath[instPckgs$LibPath==x])})
tabLibPath <- data.frame(LibPaths, countLibPaths)

instPckgs$Priority
Priorities <- unique(instPckgs$Priority)
countPriorities <- sapply(Priorities, function(x) {length(instPckgs$Priority[instPckgs$Priority==x])})
tabPriorities <- data.frame(Priorities, countPriorities)

##   * what proportion need compilation?
##   * how break down re: version of R they were built on


#' Reflections

## reflect on ^^ and make a few notes to yourself; inspiration
##   * does the number of base + recommended packages make sense to you?
##   * how does the result of .libPaths() relate to the result of .Library?


#' Going further

## if you have time to do more ...

## is every package in .Library either base or recommended?
## study package naming style (all lower case, contains '.', etc
## use `fields` argument to installed.packages() to get more info and use it!
